# Orthrus
Orthrus is a work-in-progress modding toolkit that aims to support a wide array of game file formats, to allow for blazing fast interoperability across systems and game engines. It supports no_std for embedded platforms, and tries to keep dependencies to a minimum.

## Current Formats
### ncompress - Nintendo Compression Formats
* Yay0 - used for early first-party engines on N64/GameCube
* Yaz0 - used across various first-party engines on N64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U and Switch
### panda3d - Panda3D Rendering/Game Engine
* Multifile - archive format that supports running as a full application

## Future Plans (Wishlist)
Panda3D BAM, LZ77/Okumura compression, BFSTM/BWAV, GUI/Rendering
