# Overview
orthrus-core is part of the Orthrus ecosystem of crates. This crate is designed to hold helper functions for a
variety of different operations that are common across many file formats, or that are too small to justify
their own crate.

See the main Orthrus crate, as well as Rust's documentation for more information on the provided
